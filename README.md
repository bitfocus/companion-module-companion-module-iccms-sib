See scripts section in packages.json.

## Node troubleshooting

If `yarn` is not found run `npm install -g yarn` in Node.js command prompt.

If getting error

> companion-module/base@1.2.1: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version "^18.12". Got "20.0.0"

run

`$yarn install --ignore-engines`

## Node version

Download [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

[How to switch node version](https://blog.logrocket.com/switching-between-node-versions-during-development/)

Once installation is complete, open a command window and confirm nvm is available:

`D:\>nvm version`

    1.1.10

Companion uses 18.12 only. Check current version with

    > nvm list
        *  20.0.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)
        18.12.1

Install 18.12

`nvm install 18.12`

Check that it was installed and use it.
`nvm list`
`nvm use 18.12`

    > nvm list
        20.0.0
        * 18.12.1 (Currently using 64-bit executable)

## Restore packages

`yarn`

If yarn throws err

    > Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Repos\companion-module-dev\companion-module-test_company-test_websocket\.yarn\releases\yarn-1.22.19.cjs'

run

`npm install --global yarn`

[NVM for Windows](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/1733)

    > Finally, note that if you check-in the binaries as we suggest, the semantic way to "reset" your .yarn folder is:

`rm -rf .yarn && git checkout .yarn && yarn`

## PowerShell

    The file C:\Users\dmitr\AppData\Roaming\npm\yarn.ps1 is not digitally signed.

This is a powershell security policy, to fix it, run Powershell as administrator and run the following

    `PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

If you don't want to run the command as an administrator but just for the current user, you can add a scope like below

    `PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

The stricter the policy, the more secure your system becomes.

You can change _RemoteSigned_ to other options like: Restricted, AllSigned, RemoteSigned, Unrestricted

## Packaging

### SSH
May need to add public SSH key to GitHub account.

[Error: Permission denied (publickey)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey)

Works better when running scripts in bash.

### Globals

May need to run

`npm install --global webpack`
`npm link webpack`
`npm install --global husky`
